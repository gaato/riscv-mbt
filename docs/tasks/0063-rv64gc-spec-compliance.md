# Task 0063: RV64GC Spec Compliance

## Background

The active goal is now to implement `RV64GC` correctly against the RISC-V
specifications. In explicit extension terms, this means
`RV64IMAFDC_Zicsr_Zifencei`. Linux and Alpine remain useful integration
pressure, but they are not a substitute for the architectural contract.

Recent Linux-driven work exposed that practical userspace can pass boot and
still hit holes in ordinary scalar `F/D` behavior. The current pass therefore
prioritizes closing the baseline ISA before returning to optional `V` backlog
or more OpenRC-specific probing.

## Scope

- Treat `RV64IMAFDC_Zicsr_Zifencei` as the baseline ISA target.
- Re-check the RISC-V unprivileged and privileged specs when instruction
  encodings, rounding, exception flags, CSR behavior, trap flow, or memory
  ordering rules are subtle.
- Prefer decode and execute regressions for CPU behavior.
- Keep Linux probes as integration evidence, not as the main work product.
- Add documentation-quality comments across MoonBit code as files are touched
  and during long waits.
- When roughly 3000 source lines have been added since the previous
  refactoring/tuning pass, pause feature work for a refactoring and tuning pass
  before continuing instruction or platform expansion.

## Work

- Audit current `RV64IMAFDC_Zicsr_Zifencei` instruction coverage.
- Close missing instruction families in coherent groups rather than one
  illegal instruction at a time.
- Tighten `F/D` behavior beyond the current practical host-IEEE boundary:
  fused single-rounding, `fflags`, signaling-NaN behavior, invalid/overflow
  conversion results, and reserved rounding-mode handling.
- Audit `A`, `C`, `Zicsr`, and `Zifencei` for spec gaps that are masked by
  current Linux probes.
- Promote relevant official `rv64*` riscv-tests from survey to gating when the
  emulator behavior is ready.
- Keep comments close to architectural boundaries: decode shape, execute
  semantics, CSR side effects, trap routing, translation, device interrupts,
  and test support.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `docs/current.md` identifies this task as the active next task.
- The repo has a current, explicit `RV64GC` gap list tied to code or tests.
- Missing `RV64IMAFDC_Zicsr_Zifencei` instruction families are implemented
  with decode and execute tests.
- Known deviations from strict spec behavior are documented in task notes until
  fixed.
- The normal MoonBit validation sequence passes:
  `moon check --target native`, `moon test --target native .`, `moon fmt`,
  `moon info --target native`, and `git diff --check`.

## Status

- `doing`

## Progress Notes

- `FCLASS.S` and `FCLASS.D` now decode and execute the architectural 10-bit
  classification mask for zero, subnormal, normal, infinity, signaling NaN,
  quiet NaN, and the D-present single-precision NaN-boxing path.
- `FMADD.S/D`, `FMSUB.S/D`, `FNMSUB.S/D`, and `FNMADD.S/D` now decode and
  execute under the current host-IEEE RNE-only arithmetic boundary. This closes
  the missing FMA instruction family at the instruction-availability level.
  Exact IEEE fused single-rounding and full `fflags` behavior remain open
  spec-compliance work.
- Scalar `F/D` comparisons and min/max now accrue the invalid-operation flag
  for the NaN cases required by the F specification: `FLT`/`FLE` set NV for any
  NaN input, `FEQ` sets NV only for signaling NaNs, and `FMIN`/`FMAX` set NV for
  signaling NaNs while preserving their existing result-selection behavior.
  This starts replacing the old "no FP instruction updates fflags" limitation
  with instruction-family-specific flag handling.
